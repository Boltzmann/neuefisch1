> Bootcamp project and exercises files. 

This project will have awesome projects. We will see what is happening.

## Installing / Getting started

We use Intellij for the most projects. At the moment there is no local 
installation of any package.

### Initial Configuration

You need
- jdk 17 (mac: use e.g. brew, Linux: sdkman is nice, Windows: ?)

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

## Contributing

branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

## Links

I got this README from [Jehna](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices).

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
